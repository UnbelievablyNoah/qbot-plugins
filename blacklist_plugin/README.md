Name: Blacklist System
Description: This system allows you to blacklist users from your bot! This means that the bot won't respond to the user that is blacklisted, regradless if the user has the 'Ranking Permissions' role. To install it, please install Lengo's database plugin located here: https://github.com/yogurtsyum/qbot-plugins/tree/master/qbot_database_plugin/. After that, add this code in the index.js file: https://gyazo.com/ece96a679b1c7fe782ce26c5bfb43a01. After that is done, place blacklist.js and unblacklist.js in the commands folder!
